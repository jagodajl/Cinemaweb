A cinemaweb project is a local website containing information related to films and movie stars. The appearance of the website is based on the popular Bootstrap framework. The most important feature of the project, however, is that the site uses an external API (The Movie Database, TNDb). The home page displays a list of movies along with their posters. After going into details, information about the film's plot, genre and budget is available alongsite with cast profiles.
